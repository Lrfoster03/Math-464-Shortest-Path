# Math-464-Shortest-Path
A shortest path algorithm to solve the project my Math 464 Capstone course presented

This software is designed using Python as well as the open-source package NetworkX to help alleviate the strain of the shortest path calculations. It inputs in CSV files containing the data values for lengths and delays of the graph (as adjacency matrices), and can easily be configured to work on significantly larger scales.
